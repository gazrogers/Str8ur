# Str8ur

A Scala framework in miniature. No reason other than that Scala frameworks/libraries all seem to be written for the implementer of the framework rather than the user, and I wanted something interesting to do in my spare time.

### Why "Str8ur"?

**Strwythur** is the Welsh word for structure. **Wyth** is the Welsh word for the number 8. Stick one inside the other and "Robert yw eich ewythr" as they might say.  
It's a silly name, but then so are lots of others.

It's pronounced somewhat like "Strewth" + "i" + "r" where "Strewth" is the Aussie exclamation, "i" is like the "i" in the word "it", and "r" is a rolled "r". But you can pronounce it however you like. It's not important.
